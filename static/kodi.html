    <h3 id="top">Kodi E-Z Setup Script</h3>

    <p>
      The Kodi E-Z Setup Script simplifies the installation of <a href="http://www.kodi.tv" target="_blank">Kodi Media Center</a> software on a ChromeOS device via either <a href="http://www.galliumos.org" target="_blank">GalliumOS</a>/<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> or <a href="http://www.libreelec.tv" target="_blank">LibreELEC</a>).  It is desgined to be run from ChromeOS, but can be run from any Linux which has a full Bash shell (so OpenELEC/LibreELEC users need to boot a Ubuntu Live USB (eg) and run it from there).  Currently, it allows the user to:
      <ul>
        <li>Dual Boot ChromeOS + GalliumOS/Ubuntu on internal storage</li>
        <li>Dual Boot ChromeOS + LibreELEC on internal storage</li>
        <li>Dual Boot ChromeOS + LibreELEC on external storage</li>
        <li>Set the Boot Options  (only for dual-boot setups)</li>
        <li>Update the Legacy BIOS  (only for dual-boot setups)</li>
        <li>Install/Update Custom UEFI firmware  (only for standalone setups)</li>
        <li>Create LibreELEC install media  (only for standalone setups)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      At startup, the Kodi E-Z Setup Script will automatically restrict the available menu options based on the running OS. Some of these functions involve modifying the normally read-only parts of the device's firmware, in which case the firmware write protect will need to be disabled. This is documented for each function below, and the script will likewise check the write-protect state for each function that requires it to be disabled.

    <p>
      To download and run this script, from a terminal/shell type:<br>
      <code>cd; curl -LO https://mrchromebox.tech/setup-kodi.sh && sudo bash setup-kodi.sh</code><br>
      and press enter. (copy/paste to avoid typos - the 2nd curl parameter is a capital O, not a zero)
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  If you encounter certificate related errors when downloading the script from ChromeOS, then add <code>-k</code> to the curl command and script command to bypass SSL certificate checking as so:<br>
	  <code>cd; curl -LOk https://mrchromebox.tech/setup-kodi.sh && sudo bash setup-kodi.sh -k</code><br>
	  br>

    <h3>Script Functions Explained</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Dual Boot ChromeOS + GalliumsOS</strong>
          <p>
            Dual Booting ChromeOS + Kodi via <a href="http://www.galliumos.org" target="_blank">GalliumOS</a> (or any Ubuntu flavor) is a two stage operation.  First, the partition layout is modified to make room for GalliumOS - which means shrinking the ChromeOS userdata partition by an appropriate amount.  The script will prompt the user for the amount of space to allocate for GalliumOS, with (strongly) recommended min/max values.  Once the partition table modifications are done (this is very quick), you will need to reboot, at which point ChromeOS will "repair" itself and securely wipe the resized userdata partition.  Once complete, the script must be re-run to actually install GalliumOS (and Kodi).  During the 2nd stage, the user will have the option to install either GalliumOS (a Ubuntu derivative optimized for ChromeOS devices) or their Ubuntu flavor of choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing the dual boot setup, it is recommended to boot it manually ( <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+L]</span> ) before making any changes to the boot options (see below) just in case something didn't go quite right.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> If you later wish to redo the dual boot setup with either a different version of GalliumOS/Ubuntu or with LibreELEC, only the 2nd stage will have to be redone (unless you wish to change the partition size).  If you wish to change the partition size, you'll need to do a <a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595?hl=en" target="_blank">factory reset</a> first, then re-run both stages of the dual boot setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>All Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>NO</code>

      <li><strong>Dual Boot ChromeOS + LibreELEC</strong>
          <p>
            Dual Booting ChromeOS + Kodi via <a href="http://libreelec.tv" target="_blank">LibreELEC</a> is a two stage operation.  First, the partition layout is modified to make room for LibreELEC - which means shrinking the ChromeOS userdata partition by an appropriate amount.  The script will prompt the user for the amount of space to allocate for LibreELEC, with (strongly) recommended min/max values.  Once the partition table modifications are done (this is very quick), you will need to reboot, at which point ChromeOS will "repair" itself and securely wipe the resized userdata partition.  Once complete, the script must be re-run to actually install LibreELEC. During the 2nd stage, the user will have the option to install either the current stable version or the latest beta version (if available).
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing the dual boot setup, it is recommended to boot it manually ( <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+L]</span> ) before making any changes to the boot options (see below) just in case something didn't go quite right.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>All Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>NO</code>
          </p>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Install LibreELEC on USB/SD</strong> (Dual Boot)
          <p>
            This option installs LibreELEC to the selected external media (USB, SD, USB-attached SSD, etc) along with a bootloader compatible with the stock firmware (Syslinux 6.0.3, which LibreELEC ships with, is not compatible).  The user will have the option to install either the current stable version or the latest beta version of LibreELEC (if available).
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing the install to external media, it is recommended to boot it manually ( <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+L]</span> ) before making any changes to the boot options (see below) just in case something didn't go quite right.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>All Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>NO</code>
          </p>
      </li>
      <br>
        <li><strong>Set Boot Options</strong> (Dual Boot)
          <p>
            This script function sets the ChromeOS firmware boot flags via the built-in tool <code>gbb_utility</code>.  The options presented to the user allow for setting the timeout for the ChromeOS Developer Mode boot screen (2s or 30s) and the default boot target (ChromeOS or Kodi).  For all options except 'Factory Default,' the firmware  boot flags are also set to force-enable Legacy Boot Mode, and to force-enable Developer Mode, which prevents exiting Developer Mode via the spacebar (either accidentially or intentionally).
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of which default boot target is selected, one can always override the default via keystroke on the Developer Mode boot screen: <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+D]</span> for ChromeOS Developer Mode, or <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+L]</span> for Kodi (via Legacy Boot Mode).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Whenever the firmware flags are set to anything besides the Factory Default, their current value will be displayed in a small black box in the upper-left corner of the Developer Mode boot screen, along with some other firmware-related info.  This is normal and no cause for alarm, though you'll need to re-run the script and reset the Boot Options / boot flags to Factory Default before exiting Developer Mode / resetting to stock (should you want to do so).
          </p>
          <p>
            After setting the Boot Options / firmware boot flags, the boot timeout and default OS will be whatever you selected, and can be changed at any time by re-running this script function.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>All ChromeOS devices dual-booting ChromeOS + Kodi</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>YES</code>
          </p>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Update Legacy BIOS (SeaBIOS)</strong>
          <p>
            This option sets the ChromeOS Developer Mode boot flag necessary to enable Legacy Boot mode, and it installs an RW_LEGACY firmware update appropriate for the device.  During installation, users will have the option to set the default boot device (internal storage [default] or USB/SD); Haswell/Broadwell Chromebox users will also have the option to enable "headless" (no display attached) booting, which is really only useful if you're going to run the box without a display and connect remotely (eg, via ssh) - that is to say, not at all for running Kodi.  Changing either of these options requires re-running this script function.
          </p>
          <p>
              The Legacy BIOS is automatically updated as part of any of the Dual Boot setups listed above.  It's only necessary to run this manually if you need to update, change the default boot device, or are doing a custom dual boot configuration.
          </p>
          <p>
            After updating the Legacy BIOS, Legacy Boot Mode can be accessed via <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+L]</span> on the ChromeOS Developer Mode boot screen.  It can also be set as the default by changing the firmware boot flags via 'Set Boot Options' feature above.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>All Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices dual booting ChromeOS +  Kodi</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>NO</code>
          </p>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Install/Update Custom UEFI Firmware</strong> (Standalone)
          <p>
            This will replace the stock firmware on your ChromeOS device with a custom UEFI one optimized to run Linux (and Kodi).  As this is a full replacement firmware, the script will offer users the option to back up their stock firmware on USB before updating.
          </p>
          <p>
            After installing the Custom UEFI Firmware, you will need to install a UEFI-compatible OS.  If no install media is attached or detected, your device may try (and fail) to boot ChromeOS, or it may boot the EFI shell.  Your ChromeOS device is now a "regular PC," and you can install LibreELEC (or the OS of your choice) without any special instructions*.<br>
            <br>
            *Mostly - some Ubuntu/Debian-based distros need one small adjustment -- see the FAQ page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>Select SandyBridge, all Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>YES</code>
          </p>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Create LibreELEC Install Media</strong>
          <p>
            This script function was added purely for user convenince - it automates the download of the LibreELEC install image, extracts it, and writes it to USB.  Occasionally the installation media created by this script won't boot, be it due to a problematic USB stick or a random write error.  In such a case, simply <a href="https://libreelec.tv/download-temp/" target="blank">download the LibreELEC install image</a> (Generic Build / .img.gz format) and follow the <a href="https://wiki.libreelec.tv/index.php?title=Installation" target="_blank">instructions on their wiki page</a> to create fresh install media.
          </p>
          <p>
            After flashing the custom coreboot firmware and then creating the LibreELEC install media, reboot and press <span class="keystroke">[ESC]</span> when prompted to display the boot menu, then select the USB/SD install media.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>All ChromeOS devices capable of running this script</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>NO</code>
          </p>
      </li>
      <br>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Reboot and Power Off options are (hopefully) sufficiently self-explanitory :)
