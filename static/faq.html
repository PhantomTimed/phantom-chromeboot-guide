        <h4 id="top">Q: I want to buy a Chromebook to run Windows or Linux -- which should I buy?</h4>
        <b>A: Buying any modern (2017+) Chromebook with the intention of running Windows or Linux is a terrible idea, period. Most can't boot anything other than ChromeOS, and those that can run it poorly. Older models may fair better compatibility wise, but there are still lots of caveats, and it's not recommended to buy a Chromebook as a cheap Linux device. The days where Chromebooks ran Linux well ended with the 2015 models. It would be better to run the crostini container if you buy one anyways.

        <h4 id="top">Q: I just want to boot Linux from USB on my Chromebook, what do I need to do?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> Check the Supported Devices page, to ensure your device has functional RW_LEGACY firmware available. If so, then simply put your device into Developer Mode, then run my script and update the RW_LEGACY firmware (no need to disable the firmware write protect for this). Reboot, press CTRL+L to boot in Legacy Boot Mode, then press ESC and select your USB from the boot menu. When I tested it, it powerwashed the system so be cautious of that.
    </p>

        <h4 id="top">Q: I just installed the UEFI firmware, and now my device boots to a black screen that says 'shell'
            - what do I do?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> You're in the EFI shell; the firmware boots there when it can't find a valid UEFI boot device, either
        externally (USB, SD) or internally. Just type 'exit' to get back to the the UEFI settings menu, from which you
        can select your boot device or reboot.<br><br>
        You need to install a UEFI-boot capable OS from a properly formatted USB/SD device. If you're creating the
        install media from Windows, use <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie" target="_blank">Rufus</a> to write the ISO to
        USB.<br>If writing a Windows ISO, select the ISO, then set the Partition scheme to 'MBR for UEFI' or 'GPT for
        UEFI;' 'MBR for UEFI-CSM' will not work since CSM = Legacy BIOS and the UEFI firmware doesn't support Legacy
        mode.<br> For a Linux ISO, select the ISO, then change the write mode from 'ISO Image' to 'DD Image' from the
        drop-down menu. As most Linux ISO images these days are compatible with both Legacy and UEFI booting, this
        ensures maximum compatibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="top">Q: Should I install 32 or 64-bit OS?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> The UEFI Full ROM firmware only supports 64-bit OS, so be sure to use the 'x86_64' version of whatever
        OS you want to install. USB media created from 32-bit ISOs will simply fail to boot.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="top">Q: I'm using your UEFI firmware, installed my OS [Linux], and it still boots to the EFI shell -
            what do I do?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> Sounds like your Linux distro doesn't install the EFI bootloader in the default location - no worries,
        it's an easy fix: <br><br>
        Type 'exit' to return to the UEFI settings menu, then select Boot (Maintenance) Manager. From there, select Boot
        From File, then navigate to and boot from /EFI/[distro name]/grubx64.efi (where [distro name] will be ubuntu,
        arch, debian, etc). Once your OS is booted, open a terminal/shell, and type the following (observing
        case):<br><br>
        sudo su<br>
        mkdir -p /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT<br>
        cp /boot/efi/EFI/[distro name from above]/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi<br>
        <br>
        then reboot to test. What we're doing is copying the grub EFI boot stub from the OS installed location to the
        location the firmware is expecting (/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi) on the EFI system partition (ESP), which most
        (Debian/Ubuntu-based?) distros will mount at /boot/efi. You may need to adjust slightly for your distro, but
        these instructions should work in most cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="top">Q: I'm running Legacy boot firmware now - can I switch to the UEFI firmware?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> You can, but your existing OS install won't boot. You'll need to either reinstall the OS (often the
        easiest course of action), or you can attempt to migrate your existing install, but this isn't ideal and should
        be considered unsupported.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="top">Q: I accidentally updated to the UEFI firmware, and now my existing OS won't boot - what do I do?
        </h4>
        <b>A:</b> Two options:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;1) Reinstall your OS<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;2) Boot a UEFI-capable ISO from USB (<a href="https://galliumos.org" target="_blank">GalliumOS
            2.1</a> works well here), then re-run the Firmware Utility Script. From the main menu, choose the unlock
        option (U), then you can go back to your previous firmware, by one of the following:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) restore from a backup file<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) choose the option to flash the Full ROM, then choose Legacy Boot (L) when
        prompted<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) restore the stock firmware, then re-flash either the RW_LEGACY or BOOT_STUB
        firmware, as applicable for your device<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: re-flashing the Legacy Full ROM option is only avialable to a small subset of devices - be
        sure to consult the <a href="https://mrchromebox.tech/#devices">Supported Devices page</a> to be sure it's an
        option for your device.

        <h4 id="top">Q: The Windows installer says none of my partitions are large enough to install Windows - help?
        </h4>
        <b>A:</b> When installing Windows on the internal storage of a ChromeOS device (which is usually 16/32GB at
        best), you need to first delete all the existing (ChromeOS) partitions -- even the EFI system partition -- and
        then choose to install Windows into the unpartitioned space.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="top">Q: I flashed the firmware and need to install an OS, but my USB drive isn't detected/isn't booting
            - what now?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> If you are having problems with USB drives not detecting:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you created the USB install media correctly:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Be sure to use a 64-bit OS; on the Windows side, use only Windows 10 and higher -- Windows 7 will not work, Win
                8/8,1 doesn't support all the required drivers; 32-bit anything (Windows or Linux) will not work (the
                UEFI firmware is 64-bit only)</li>
            <li>For Windows, use Rufus or the Windows Media Creation Tool. Almost any options in Rufus should work, but
                UEFI/GPT is recommended. FAT vs NTFS should not matter. The UEFI firmware supports both</li>
            <li>For Linux, ensure your distro supports UEFI. Any tool that supports UEFI Linux (such as Rufus) or a dd
                mode or dd itself on any *nix should be able to make a working installation USB. Do <b>not</b> use
                Unetbootin. It is known to have issues making UEFI-capable installation USBs.<br>
            <li>On Chromeboxes, the rear ports are more reliable, so use those. Also, sometimes USB keyboards can
                interfere with detection of USB media, so try booting without the keyboard connected.<br>
            <li>Any blogs, guides, or instructions that tell you to enable Legacy/CSM mode as part of installation are
                not relevant for ChromeOS hardware and should be discarded completely. The UEFI firmware does not
                support Legacy/CSM mode. All new PCs, even if they have a Legacy/CSM mode, ship with UEFI as the
                default. Windows 8+ has good UEFI support. Linux has had EFI/UEFI support for over a decade. macOS has
                never supported Legacy BIOS. Common *BSD variants either have UEFI support or are in the process of
                adding it. You should not need any Legacy mode. The issue may also be fixed by using a different port.</li>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some drives are slow and the firmware does not detect them in one go:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>The EFI shell is your friend: just type "exit" to go to the GUI menu</li>
            <li>If you can't get a drive to detect at power on, try plugging it in on the shell page, then exiting the
                shell with "exit" and see if it appears under "Boot Menu"</li>
            <li>If not, got to "Boot Manager" and, with the USB drive still plugged in, pick "Reset System." This will
                reset with the USB drive still partly powered on and will increase the odds of proper detection</li>
            <li>You might also try putting a powered hub between the USB drive and ChromeOS device. That can help
                improve the odds of proper detection if the drive is not powering on in time</li>
            <li>USB drive still not detecting? Try another drive. Also, some people have reported higher success rates
                with SD cards</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h4 id="top">Q: I just installed the UEFI firmware on a Braswell device, and the built-in keyboard doesn't work
            under Linux - how to fix?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> As specifically mentioned in the firmware release notes, kernel 4.13 or newer must be used for the
        keyboard to be functional, due to a bug in earlier versions. GalliumOS is the recommended distro if you want
        everything to work OOTB; use the 2.2-pre ISO linked in the release notes on the home page.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="top">Q: UEFI is cool and all, but I'd like to revert to ChromeOS. How can I do that?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> No problem, you just need to restore the stock firmware first: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Boot a 64-bit Linux Live USB (GalliumOS or Ubuntu, eg)</li>
            <li>Run the Firmware Utility Script (on Ubuntu, may need to install curl first: sudo apt install curl)</li>
            <li>Select the option to restore the stock firmware, follow the prompts and reboot when complete</li>
            <li>Insert Recovery media when prompted</li>
            <li>After Recovery complete, run Firmware Utility Script again, and reset the firmware boot flags to default
            </li>
            <li>(Optional) Reboot, and exit Developer Mode</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="top">Q: I'm trying to exit Developer Mode, but when I press space to exit it says:<br>
            "WARNING: TONORM prohibited by GBB_FORCE_DEV_SWITCH_ON" - how to I fix this?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> The 'Set Boot Options (GBB Flags)' option of the Firmware Utility Script automatically sets the GBB
        Flag to force Developer Mode on when a non-default option is selected, to mitigate the problem of accidentally
        exiting Developer Mode and wiping your ChromeOS user data. To clear the GBB flags / reset them to factor
        default, simply re-run the Firmware Utility Script and choose the option to reset the GBB Flags to factory
        default.  You can also do this from a ChromeOS terminal with the following command: sudo
        /usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x0
        and then reboot
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="top">Q: I'm trying to install ChromeOS Flex/CloudReady and use in a managed environment, but getting an error related to the TPM  - how to I fix this?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> The current UEFI firmware for Chromebooks doesn't support TPM management from the firmware interface, so you'll need to boot a Linux USB and reset the TPM from there.<br>
        This is most easily done with GalliumOS, but any distro with the `tpm-tools` package should work.<br>
        Distros other than GalliumOS may require booting with the `tpm_tis.interrupts=0` kernel parameter added.<br>
        Boot your live USB, install tpm-tools, then clear the TPM:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt install tpm-tools<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo tpm_clear --force<br>
        then reboot, and Cloudready should work without issue.
        Besides, just restore Stock Firmware if you want ChromeOS.
    </p>

        <h4 id="top">Q: I am trying to boot GalliumOS (or another Linux distro) from USB and getting an error: <br>
            "error: unknown filesystem. alloc magic is broken at 0x78cd97c0" -- how do I fix it? </h4>
        <b>A:</b> Your ISO wasn't written to USB properly -- as an image, not an ISO -- and you need to redo it using the proper tool/settings. Etcher or Rufus in dd mode are the recommended options. The ChromeOS Recovery tool also works properly.
    </p>

        <h4 id="top">Q: How can I get audio working under Linux on a Apollolake Chromebook?</h4>
        <b>A:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>Ensure you are using a distro with kernel 5.15 or newer</li>
			<li>Ensure the Sound Open Firmware (SOF) blobs are installed. The package name varies by distribution; on Ubuntu 21.xx it's 'firmware-sof-signed'</li>
			<li>As sudo, create the file /etc/modprobe.d/inteldsp.conf ; via a text editor set the contents to 'options snd-intel-dspconfig dsp_driver=3', then save and reboot</li> 
		</ul>
