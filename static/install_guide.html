<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:36px;"><strong><u>Install Guide</u></strong></span><br>Welcome to the Chromeboot Install Guide, this will guide you through installing chromeboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:28px;">Initial Setup:</span><br>Before we can Chromeboot our device, Google very obviously doesn't let consumers do this by default.<br>There are some things we need to do before we can do this.<br>Please identify your devices release date and use them accordingly.<br><br><span style="font-size:20px;">Pre-2017 Chromebooks</span></p>
<p>Since Google didn't put a TPM chip that controls write-protect, this will be easier.</p>
<p>1. Unscrew the back of your Chromebook and pry it off. (You can look at a iFixIt guide if you need more info.)<br>2. (I don't own one, so this may not be optimal) Unscrew every screw and put it back in if it doesn't have conductive pads below it.<br>3. Once one with conductive pads is found, don't screw it back in and store the screw somewhere safe.<br>4. Put the back onto the device, and screw it back in. You are now ready to flash firmware! Continue to the Flashing Guide.<br><br><span style="font-size:20px;">2017+ Chromebooks</span></p>
<p>Googles grown another eye, so this guide will be a bit harder.<br><br>1. Unscrew the back of your Chromebook and pry it off. (You can look at a iFixit guide if you need more info)<br>2. Disconnect the battery safely. Avoid using metal objects as this may short out a pin.<br>3. Put the back onto the Chromebook, but&nbsp;<strong>DON'T&nbsp;</strong>click it back on. Instead, place it onto the Chromebook and rotate the device.<br>4. Plug the Chromebook into power. If you did everything before, there should now be a red flashing light. Power the device on<br>5. If not already, put the device into developer mode. You can do this by pressing Esc+Refresh+Power on most models, then pressing CTRL+D and ENTER.<br>6. Log into an account. A guest one is perfectly fine for this.<br>7. Open a VT-2 terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+F2. Log in as user "chronos". No password will be required, nor should one be set.<br>8. Type in 'sudo sh', then type&nbsp;'flashrom -p internal —wp-disable'<br>9. You've completed the process! You should reboot your device, or if you wish to connect the battery shut it down instead.</p>
<p><br><span style="font-size:28px;">Flashing the Firmware</span></p>
<p>With all of that done, we can now start flashing firmware.</p>
<p>1. Download and start the firmware utility using this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">cd; curl -LO evillaugherw.github.io/phantom-chromeboot-guide/firmware-util.sh &amp;&amp; sudo bash firmware-util.sh&nbsp;</code></pre>
<p>2. Wait for it to load.<br>3. Once it has loaded, you should see this screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://evillaugherw.github.io/phantom-chromeboot-guide/images/fwutil_cros_wp-off.png" alt="" width="573" height="374"></p>
<p>"Fw WP" should say disabled. If not, go back to Initial Setup.<br>4. You've made it this far! Go ahead and press "2".<br>Follow the warnings, plug in external media for your backup and your done! ChromeOS is no longer bootable, so you must get another media device that has a UEFI-compatible OS loaded.</p>
<p>If you require to go back to stock firmware, the tool has a feature for that. You just need a backup, or there are other options. Launch a Linux Live USB (or use your existing install) then download and run the firmware util. Press on “Restore Stock Firmware”, insert a recovery usb, a usb containing a firmware backup, or if possible download it from the internet. The tool will guide you through!</p>
